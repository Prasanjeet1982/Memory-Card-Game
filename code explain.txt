Explanation for each major component of the code, including classes, functions, and routes.

1. **Imports and Setup:**

   ```python
   import random
   from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect
   from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles
   from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse
   from starlette.routing import WebSocketRoute
   from starlette.templating import Jinja2Templates
   ```

   - Import necessary modules, including FastAPI, WebSocket, and related components for serving static files and rendering templates.

2. **FastAPI App and Static Files:**

   ```python
   app = FastAPI()
   app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="static"), name="static")
   ```

   - Create a FastAPI app instance.
   - Mount the `/static` route to serve static files (CSS, JavaScript) from the `static` directory.

3. **Jinja2 Templates:**

   ```python
   templates = Jinja2Templates(directory="templates")
   ```

   - Initialize Jinja2 templates for rendering HTML templates located in the `templates` directory.

4. **Game Class:**

   ```python
   class Game:
       # ... (methods and attributes)
   ```

   - Define a `Game` class that represents the Memory Card Game.
   - The class encapsulates the game's logic and state.

5. **Game Initialization and Board Setup:**

   ```python
   def __init__(self, rows: int, cols: int):
       # ... (initialize attributes)
   ```

   - Constructor for the `Game` class.
   - Initializes the game with the specified number of rows and columns.
   - Sets up the game board by creating pairs of symbols and shuffling them.

6. **Card Flipping and Matching:**

   ```python
   def flip_card(self, row: int, col: int):
       # ... (flip_card method)

   def check_match(self):
       # ... (check_match method)

   def reset_flipped(self):
       # ... (reset_flipped method)
   ```

   - `flip_card`: Flips a card at the specified row and column, allowing players to select cards to flip.
   - `check_match`: Checks if the flipped cards form a matching pair.
   - `reset_flipped`: Resets the list of flipped cards after checking for a match.

7. **Create Game Instance:**

   ```python
   game = Game(rows=4, cols=4)
   ```

   - Creates an instance of the `Game` class with 4 rows and 4 columns.

8. **WebSocket Communication:**

   ```python
   @app.websocket("/ws")
   async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
       # ... (WebSocket communication logic)
   ```

   - Defines a WebSocket endpoint for handling game communication with clients.
   - Accepts WebSocket connections, receives card flip data, checks for matches, and sends match results.

9. **HTML Interface:**

   ```python
   @app.get("/", response_class=HTMLResponse)
   async def read_root():
       # ... (route to render game interface)
   ```

   - Defines a route to render the game interface using a Jinja2 template.
   - Renders the `index.html` template and passes data like the number of rows and columns to the template.

10. **WebSocket Route:**

    ```python
    @app.websocket_route("/ws-feed")
    async def websocket_route():
        # ... (WebSocket route for serving WebSocket communication)
    ```

    - Defines a WebSocket route for serving the WebSocket communication.

The code creates a basic web-based Memory Card Game using FastAPI and WebSocket communication. Players can interact with the game through a web interface, flip cards, and the game communicates real-time card matching results using WebSocket. The `Game` class handles the game's logic and state, ensuring that the rules of the Memory Card Game are followed. The code is organized, making it easier to understand and extend for further development.
